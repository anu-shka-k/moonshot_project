- **Objective**: To develop a cost-effective, reliable, and portable system for the early detection of cardiac issues such as Arrhythmias and Cardiomyopathy, enabling at-home monitoring and diagnosis.

- **Challenges**:
    - Early detection of cardiac abnormalities requires accurate and sensitive diagnostic tools.
    - At-home devices must balance simplicity with diagnostic accuracy.
    - Data transmission, privacy, and storage in wearable or at-home systems.

- **Target Users**: Individuals at risk of cardiac issues, including elderly populations, patients with a family history of heart diseases, and those with prior cardiovascular conditions.
